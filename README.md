Trying to create a custom function for Apache Drill
========================================

This is a simplified attempt to create a custom function for Apache Drill around an (existing) Java library.

In this test project the "existing" library is just another Maven module.

Problems I'm trying to figure out are mainly related to how I can unit test if I have done things right.

Current status: It doesn't work yet.
